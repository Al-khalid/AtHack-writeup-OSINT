رمز رقم 1 OSINT{Rick's House - HARD}
The challenge description tells you that there this guy called Rick Eviltn and they told you to find his house



رمز رقم 2 First things i did was google his name Rick Eviltn 
found a youtube channel it had two videos and they had 0 views at the time of the contest first thing that came to my mind bingo frame by frame or sound reverse did that but sadly nothing i didnt watch the other video ---


رمز رقم 3--- cuz it was 3 mins and i thought it was just a waste of time what came to my mind after that was if there is a youtube there is other accounts so i lunched Sherlock tool which checks all social media pages depending on your input



رمز رقم 4the tool gave me his Instagram account it had 5 images one was obviously a decoy cuz of the mouse cursor that was in-image i skipped that pic and looked in the other pics doing reverse image search did nothing good so i started googling about the text in the images and found --


رمز رقم 5 that all other 3 pics are in Tunisia -  Ariana
anyway i wasted too much time on Gmaps and Google Earth after searching more and more i thought google maps is a rabbit hole so i skipped it and went again to Sherlock this time i gave Sherlock reviltn as a username 
#AtHack


رمز رقم 6 it gave me a twitter account 
@reviltn
 which is basically waste of time  anyway i started searching photo sites about his username after searching i remember flicker which allow you to upload images with its original exif so i went to http://flicker.com and looked for --


 رمز رقم 7-- rick eviltn found it with 4 photos downloaded them and used exiftool to get its info but it was useless it had no location or anything so i used binwalk and found that the pics had hidden videos inside so i extracted them using binwalk -e photo_name --



 رمز رقم 8anyhow the videos was another rabbit hole it was a video of "Rick" censoring people faces which was useless so while looking at flicker i found it has a map function so i used it and moved to where all the images were taken and boom #AtHack


 رمز رقم 9 the flag was simply the building name as they said AtHackCTF{Residence-Les-Violettes}
and thats it thanks for reading wish that you had fun like i did
